## Design Choices

### Fonts

I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to aid me in selecting a suitable font. To keep the font for this game to a clean and simple look, I have chosen [Unbutu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu). This is the only one that I will use as I don't feel there is enough content involved to warrant complicating the look with different fonts for headers and text.

### Icons

I will use some icons to enhance the user experience for the choice of categories, they will not be stand-alone but there to accompany the text and break up the look of all text. The icons will be sourced from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). 

### Colours

To create the colour scheme for the page, I used [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp). I  I decided that as this was not a complex project where lots of different colours were needed, I would only use two. The colour scheme can be seen here ![colors](assets/images/colors.png). 

### Structure

I will be building my website with a mobile-first approach. Using the Chrome developer tools to give me the iPhone 5/SE (320px), I will use this as the smallest screen size for styling.

### Features

This a small projcet with limited functionalities and only one page.
